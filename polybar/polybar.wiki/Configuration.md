The parameters below are using the default values unless stated otherwise. If the key is undefined (commented out) or its value is empty, it means there is no default value for the given parameter.

## Syntax and Domain Specific Language
The configuration uses the [INI file
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file), the full specification can be
found [here](https://polybar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/man/polybar.5.html).

```dosini
[section/name]
str = My string
bool = true
bool = on
int = 10
float = 10.0

; Quote string values if you want to keep surrounding spaces
str = "   My string"

; Lists are defined using a 0-based index
mylist-0 = value
mylist-1 = value
mylist-2 = value
; Lists cannot have gaps. To define mylist-4 
; you will also have to define mylist-3
```

## Referencing values
```dosini
; You can reference a value in another section using:
key = ${section.key}

; Values in the same section can be referenced using:
key = ${self.key}

; Values for a defined bar can be referenced using:
key = ${bar/top.foreground}

; Values for the current bar can be referenced using:
key = ${root.foreground}

; Environment variables can be referenced using:
key = ${env:VAR:fallback value}

; Values in the X resources db can be referenced using:
; NOTE: Requires `+xrm` (compiled with `xcb-util-xrm` dependency)
; Example: 
; Polybar config:
;     background = ${xrdb:color2:#00ff00}
; .Xresources:
;     *color2: #8C9440
key = ${xrdb:KEY:fallback value}

; File contents can be referenced using:
key = ${file:/absolute/file/path:fallback value}
```

**Note:** References can only be used on their own. That means something like 
`key = text ${section.key} text` will not work (the reference will not be resolved).

## Inheritance
Values can be inherited from another section by defining the parameter `inherit = section/base`.
All undefined keys will be cloned.
```dosini
[section/base]
foo = 1
bar = 0.15
baz = true

[section/child]
inherit = section/base
baz = false

; Result
[section/child]
foo = 1
bar = 0.15
baz = false
```

Multiple sections can be inherited by adding multiple space separated section
names to the inherit key: `inherit = section1 section2`.

## File inclusion
It is possible to include a file or all files in a directory with pre-defined
key-value pairs using:

```dosini
include-file = /absolute/path/to/file
include-directory = /absolute/path/to/directory
; Relative paths are new in version 3.6.0
include-file = relative/path/to/file
include-directory = relative/path/to/directory
```

This is equivalent to replacing the `include-file` directive with the contents
of the file.

The `include-directory` directive will include all files in the given directory
(non-recursively) the same way as multiple `include-file` directives. Files are
included in alphabetical order.

**Note:** The files included that way can also contain further `include-file`
and `include-directory` keys. Make sure that you do not create a cycle where a
file includes itself directly or indirectly.

Multiple include directives can be defined inside a section because they are not
proper config keys.

When specifying a relative path, the path is taken relative to the file where
the include directive is defined. 

## Custom variables
```dosini
; You can create your own local variables, for example:
[colors]
black = #000
white = #fff
blue = #00f
green = #0f0

[modules/tmp]
format-background = ${colors.black}
format-foreground = ${colors.white}
```

### Using the same module for multiple bars
If you are using the same module for more than one bar, there's a neat 
way to make bar specific changes to the module configuration. 
Define some custom parameters, for both bars, and then reference them from the module. For example:
```dosini
[bar/top]
myscript-background = #f00
myscript-command = whoami

[bar/bottom]
myscript-background = #f00
myscript-command = date +%s

[module/myscript]
format-background = ${root.myscript-background}
exec = ${root.myscript-command}
```

## Bar settings

Each bar you want to display needs a so called "bar section".
The bar section is defined as a config section that begins with `bar/` and is
followed by the name of the bar.

***Note*** For configuring multiple monitors automatically see https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/763

```dosini
[bar/mybar]
; Use either of the following command to list available outputs:
; $ polybar -M | cut -d ':' -f 1
; $ xrandr -q | grep " connected" | cut -d ' ' -f1

monitor =

monitor-strict = false

; Use fuzzy matching for monitors (only ignores dashes -)
; Useful when monitors are named differently with different drivers.
monitor-exact = true

; Tell the Window Manager not to configure the window.
; Use this to detach the bar if your WM is locking its size/position.
; Note: With this most WMs will no longer reserve space for 
; the bar and it will overlap other windows. You need to configure
; your WM to add a gap where the bar will be placed.
override-redirect = false

; Put the bar at the bottom of the screen
bottom = false

; Prefer fixed center position for the `modules-center` block. 
; The center block will stay in the middle of the bar whenever

; the left and right block.

; Individual side values can be defined using:
;   border-{left,top,right,bottom}-size
;   border-{left,top,right,bottom}-color
; The top and bottom borders are added to the bar height, so the effective
; window height is:
;   height + border-top-size + border-bottom-size
; Meanwhile the effective window width is defined entirely by the width key and
; the border is placed within this area. So you effectively only have the
; following horizontal space on the bar:
;   width - border-right-size - border-left-size
; border-size supports any percentage with offset.
; For border-{left,right}-size, the percentage is relative to the monitor width
; and for border-{top,bottom}-size, it is relative to the monitor height.

## Module Settings

A module is defined as a config section that begins with `module/` and is
followed by the name of the module (this can be different from the module type).

```dosini
; Defines a module named 'mymodule'
[module/mymodule]
; The type of this module
; The wiki pages for the individual modules show the correct value for that module.
type = ...

; Hide the module by default
; Default: false
; New in version 3.6.0
hidden = true
```
