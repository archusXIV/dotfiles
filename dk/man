DK(1)                                 General Commands Manual                                 DK(1)

NAME
       dk - A tiling window manager in the vein of dwm, bspwm, and xmonad.

SYNOPSIS
       dk [-vh]

       dkcmd [-vh] [-p [FILE]] [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       Windows  are  managed in various layouts, and are grouped by workspaces.  Each window can be
       assigned to a single workspace and will have a small border to  indicate  the  focus  state.
       Changes to one workspace will not impact others. Workspaces can be dynamically or statically
       assigned and viewed on any monitor, by default only one workspace per monitor is created.

       Monitors can be assigned one workspace at a time, all workspaces are available from all mon‐
       itors in dynamic mode, floating windows will retain their relative location within each mon‐
       itor  area.  If  viewing an already visible workspace on another monitor, the two workspaces
       will swap monitors when dynamic, otherwise the mouse will be warped to the assigned monitor.

       In tiled layout windows are organized in a master and two stack areas, the number of masters
       and first stack windows can be adjusted from 0-n with the second stack  containing  all  re‐
       maining windows.

       In monocle layout windows are maximized and stacked on top of each other with only one visi‐
       ble at a time.

       In grid layout windows attempt to occupy equal space with all being visible.

       In spiral and dwindle layout windows occupy 1/2 the space of the previous, moving inwards to
       the center of the screen or outwards to the bottom right respectively.

       In  floating  layout  windows  are  not organized or placed in any particular way and can be
       moved or resized freely.

OPTIONS
       -h     Prints usage information to stdout and exits.

       -v     Prints version information to stdout and exits.

       -p     Pretty format JSON input from FILE or STDIN and print on STDOUT.

CUSTOMIZATION
       For basic changes dk can be customized by running commands through the dkcmd program.

       On startup dk looks for a dkrc file in:

       • $DKRC

       • $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dk/dkrc

       • $HOME/.config/dk/dkrc

       and runs the first it can, this file must be executable.  This can  be  used  to  initialize
       settings, customization, and running programs.

       Further  configuration  such  as  adding  layouts  or  callbacks can be done by copying con‐
       fig.def.h to config.h, editing it, and recompiling.

DKCMD
       Most of your interaction with the window manager will be using dkcmd  which  writes  one  or
       more commands into the socket where it is then read and parsed by the window manager.

Syntax Outline
       The  commands  have  a  very basic syntax and parsing, the input is broken down into smaller
       pieces (tokens) which are then passed to the matching keyword function, otherwise  an  error
       is returned.

       Tokens are delimited by one or more:

       • whitespace (space or tab)

       • quotation mark (' or ")

       • equal sign (=)

       This means the following inputs are all equivalent.

              setting=value
              setting value
              setting="value"
              setting = 'value'
              setting "value"
              setting     "value"

       and result in two tokens: setting and value Quotation exists as a way to preserve whitespace
       and  avoid  interpretation  by the shell, otherwise we have no way of determining whether an
       argument is a continuation of the previous or the beginning of the next. If the value  being
       matched has quotes in it, they can be escaped or strong quoted

              title="^\"preserved quotes\"$"
              title='^"preserved quotes"$'

       For various commands dk will expect a certain data type or format to be given.

       • string: normal plain text, must be less than 256 characters.

       • boolean: true, false, 1, or 0.

       • hex: (0x/#)XXXXXXXX, used for window ids

       • integer: (+/-)1, if it is preceded by a sign it is considered relative.

       • float: (+/-)0.1, same as integer but must contain a decimal value.

       • colour: (0x/#)[AA]RRGGBB, hex value, if no alpha channel is given the colour is opaque.
